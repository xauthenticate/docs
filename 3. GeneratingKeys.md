# Generating license keys

### Generating license keys
To generate license keys, navigate to the "License Keys" tab at the top of the screen, then navigate to the "Generate" tab at the left side of the dashboard.

> ### Important
> If you have created multiple projects, ensure that you are creating license keys for the correct project by clicking on your project from the "Projects" menu at the top left of the dashboard. Alternatively, you can check the "Current Project" text above the "Generate Keys" heading.

**Key generation options:**
 - **Key Mask**: Defines a "mask" when generating the key strings.
   - Some characters will be replaced with a randomized character if needed. **"\$A"** will be replaced with a random uppercase letter, **"\$a"** will be replaced with a random lowercase letter, and **"\$0"** will be replaced with a random number.
   - Example: The mask "`$A$A$A$A$A$A$A$A-$a$a$a$a-$0$0`" generated the key "`RISHSGFB-fpxc-44`".
 - **Length (Hours)**: Sets the key provisioning length, in hours. When the key is used for the first time, the expiration date will be created in the future by the amount of hours set here.
 - **Quantity**: The number of individual keys to generate.
 - **Enable Hardware Lock**: Whether or not the new keys should have Hardware ID locking enabled. This prevents users from sharing the same key across multiple computers.
   - This can be changed later for any key from the Licenses dashboard.
 - **Description (optional)**: A private user-defined description for the key. This is not visible to the customer.

After entering your options, press the "Generate" button to generate the specified amount of keys. The new keys that were generated will be visible in the "New Keys" box below the button. Alternatively, you can navigate to the "Licenses" panel to see all of the keys for your project.
