# Setting up the SDK

### Including the SDK
Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Getting Started](/docs/GettingStarted) to include the SDK in your project and link the appropriate library file (`XAuth.lib`).

Next, include the XAuth header file in one of your C++ source files:

```C++
#include "XAuth.h"
```

Finally, you can construct the class using your project secret and run the initialization function.

```C++
XAuthProvider Provider("Your project secret here!");
Provider.Initialize();
```

> Click [here](/docs/ProjectSecret) for more information on obtaining your project secret.

Initializing the XAuthProvider class will test the connection to the license key provisioning server, as well as querying project permissions/requirements (such as whether or not reverse-engineering protection is enabled).
