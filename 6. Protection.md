# Using reverse-engineering protection

> ### Important
> Reverse-engineering protection is only available for projects owned by a user with a **Plus** or **Pro** XAuthenticate plan.

### Setting up the SDK
Make sure that you have followed the steps in [Getting Started](/docs/GettingStarted) and [Setting Up the SDK](/docs/SettingUp) to initialize the SDK.

### Protection settings
The SDK includes the class `XAuthProtectionSettings` to manage settings for the protection module.

> All of the items below are well-documented inside of the SDK header file as well.

Available to **Plus** and **Pro** users:
 - bool **`DebuggerCheck`**: Detects various types of debuggers accessing the process.
 - bool **`BlacklistedProgramCheck`**: Detects running processes against a known blacklist.
 - bool **`BlacklistedServiceCheck`**: Detects services against a known blacklist.
 - std::string **`WorkingDirectory`**: Whether the process should be started in a specific working directory. Leave blank to ignore.
 - std::string **`Filename`**: Whether the process should have a specific filename or not. Leave blank to ignore.
 - 
Only available to **Pro** users:
 - bool **`DNSCheck`**: Detects some types of network proxies used by network traffic sniffers such as Fiddler and Burp Suite, as well as some VPNs.
 - bool **`VirtualizationCheck`**: Detects for process virtualization using various methods.
 - bool **`MemoryCorruptionCheck`**: Detects low-level "memory corruption" attacks.

### Example usage:

```C++
#include "XAuth.h"
#include <vector>

void OnDetected(std::vector<std::string> AllDetections) {
    for (const std::string& Detection : AllDetections) {
        std::cout << "Detection: " << Detection << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    XAuthProvider Provider("Your project secret here!");
    Provider.Initialize();

    XAuthProtectionSettings ProtectionSettings;
    ProtectionSettings.Filename = "Example.exe";
    Provider.BeginProtection(ProtectionSettings, OnDetected);

    return 0;
}
```
