# Welcome to XAuthenticate

> ### SDK Download
> To get started, download the XAuth software development kit (SDK) from [here](TODO)

### Including and linking the SDK

The SDK is included in two parts: The header file and the library. 
 1. The header file (.h) contains function and class declarations, and should be added to your project accordingly.
 2. The library (.lib) contains the function definitions used by XAuthenticate. It should be linked with the finished build using your compiler's linker.

### Linking the SDK

If you do not link the `XAuth.lib` library, you will get "unresolved external symbol" errors thrown by your compiler.
 - **Visual Studio**: Open your Project Properties, and navigate to the VC++ Directories menu. Add the path where `XAuth.lib` is located to the Library Directories. Then, navigate to Linker->Input and add the entry for `XAuth.lib` under the "Additional Dependencies" list. Alternatively, you can also add the line `#pragma comment(lib, "XAuth.lib")` to one of your C++ source files.

> ### Important Notes
>  - The library (`XAuth.lib`) is compiled for the **x64** architecture with debug symbols **disabled**. This means that your project should be built with the **NDEBUG** preprocessor definition if necessary.
>  - Library code is written and compiled using the **ISO C++20** standard, using Windows SDK 10.0 and the **v142** (Visual Studio 2019) Platform Toolset.
>  - Classes included with the SDK are well-documented using comments in the header file.
