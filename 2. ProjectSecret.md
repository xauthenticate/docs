# Finding your project secret

To find your project secret for use in the XAuth SDK, visit your Account Settings dashboard.

There, you will find a list of every project you have created, along with a button that says "Copy Secret to Clipboard".

The project secret should be entered when constructing the `XAuthProvider` class from the SDK:

```C++
XAuthProvider Provider("Your project secret here!");
Provider.Initialize();
```
