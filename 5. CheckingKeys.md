# Checking license keys

### Setting up the SDK
Make sure that you have followed the steps in "Welcome to XAuth" and "Setting Up the SDK" to initialize the SDK.

### Querying the key
Find a way to receive the key input from the user. This can be done through the console, for instance, using `std::cin`, but it can also be done in many other ways.

Once you have the license key input, it can be passed to the (already initialized!) Provider object::

```C++
std::string UserLicenseKey = "Example Key";
XAuthKeyCheckResponse Response = Provider.CheckKey(UserLicenseKey);
```

After this function finishes executing, you can parse the response from it (`XKeyCheckResponse`) for useful information.

Information included in `XKeyCheckResponse`:
 - Whether or not the key is valid and can be used.
 - A string containing the expiration date of the key.
   - This string can be shown to the user if needed.
 - An integer containing the raw timestamp of the expiration date.
   - This can be used to generate your own expiration date string to be shown to the user instead of the default one.
 - A reason that the login failed (if it failed).
   - This string can be shown to the user if needed, or it can be parsed and replaced with your own.

### Example usage:

```C++
#include "XAuth.h"

int main() {
    XAuthProvider Provider("Your project secret here!");
    Provider.Initialize();

    std::string UserLicenseKey = "Example Key";
    XKeyCheckResponse Response = Provider.CheckKey(UserLicenseKey);

    if (Response.LoginSuccess) {
        std::cout << "Logged in successfully!" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Expiration date: " << Response.ExpirationString << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Login failed!" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Reason: " << Response.LoginFailedReason << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
